## Adventure time!
While traveling together in Iceland in 2015, we both fell in love with the country so much that we wanted our closest family and friends to see it too.  

The official wedding events are happening from **July 2 - 5** in Iceland. **To best experience Iceland, we recommend staying *at least¬†*one week.**

Can't make it to Iceland? Join us at our [reception in the San Francisco Bay Area in August 2017](/banquet). (Remember to let us know if you're coming)
