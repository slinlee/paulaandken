## CELEBRATE
 
<font size="3">In the fall of 2016, we visited Artipelag as part of a trip to Scandinavia. So much about this museum appealed to us - the sleek glass-walled architecture, the manageable size of the exhibition (on Warhol at the time) and in particular, its magical pine forest surroundings.

When it came time to choose a location for our wedding, we wanted a place that spoke to both of us. Artipelag melds contemporary art and nature into one experience, which feels right as our wedding venue because it mirrors us, reflecting our separate interests that have become increasingly shared.
 
As we prepare for the wedding, we've been thinking a lot about the friends and family who have helped shape us individually and have supported us as a couple. You mean so much to us and we can't wait to celebrate with you in one of our favorite corners of the world.</font>
 
## OUR STORY

<section id="two" class="wrapper alt style2">
						<section class="spotlight">
							<div class="image"><img src="images/wedding/Paula drink_rotated.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="content">
	<h5>One fall evening in 2013...</h5>
								<p>Paula made a fateful decision ‚Äì instead of cozying up in her UWS studio with a Netflix DVD, she went out. It was Friday night, after all, and she was single. Paula made her way over to Liberty Bar near K-town where someone she knew was having a birthday party.</p>

							<div class="image"><img src="images/wedding/Ken drink.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="content">
								<p>Ken also made a fateful decision, one he still makes nearly every weekend - to stay out that Friday night, which began for him at happy hour and ended at his fourth stop, Liberty Bar. When introduced to Paula, he was on his thirteenth drink that evening yet remained impressively coherent.

	<div class="image"><img src="images/wedding/Ken phone.jpg" alt=""><font size="1"><i>The notes are still in Ken‚Äôs phone, plus two addendums later in 2013.</i></font></div><div class="content">
								<p>Paula was instantly taken by the fit of Ken‚Äôs shirt and his liquid-fueled confidence. She also liked that Ken had set a photo of Machu Picchu as his iPhone background, as she had also done the trek. Ken was impressed by Paula‚Äôs drink order of Jameson on the rocks and was tricked into thinking Paula was athletic by her casual mention of the century bicycle rides she had done that year. He asked for her number and then jotted down observations about her into his phone: Wharton, Whitney/Cerritos, Cannondale, Amazing.

								<p>Ken waited two days to text Paula, per ‚ÄúThe Game.‚Äù She was at The Brooklyn Book Festival and knew how to play that game, too - she waited to text him back until later that evening. They went on their first date at Kashkaval (RIP), a casual Mediterranean wine bar in Midtown West. It went just okay but not so badly that Paula would refuse a second date - so, they met again at Khe-Yo in Tribeca where Ken made an outsized impression by showing up in a tailored suit. Sparks were reignited. Dates three and four followed in quick succession, where they shared about their families, discussed their dreams and deepened their connection.

								<p>Their fifth date was at The Rose Bar in Gramercy, three weeks after they first met. With the sound of Brian Newman‚Äôs trumpet in the background, Ken took Paula‚Äôs hand and asked an old-fashioned question, ‚ÄúWill you be my girlfriend?‚Äù It was made official in the following moment, when both their Coffee Meets Bagel accounts were summarily deleted.

								<p>The next time Ken asked Paula an old-fashioned question while holding her hand was at a bench in Central Park, four years later. By then, Paula knew that Ken was The One. She had felt his love early on, when he had spent his Saturdays helping her do laundry at the laundromat down the street from her walk-up. She found his tendencies endearing ‚Äì how he ensured all their devices were always charged, how he thoroughly read every placard he came upon, whether at a museum or while walking by a random statue, and even how he vigilantly placed coasters beneath every beverage at their hosted get-togethers. She loved laughing with him and how he made her feel secure and prioritized. As for Ken, he had felt sure of Paula since he took those notes about her on Day 1.
