## CELEBRATE
 
###### In the fall of 2016, we visited Artipelag as part of a trip to Scandinavia. So much about the museum appealed to us - the sleek design that nods to "The Glass House," its manageable size and in particular, its magical location in woodsy surroundings.

###### When it came time to choose a location for the wedding, we wanted to settle on a place that spoke to both of us. Artipelag melds contemporary art and nature into one package, a combination that feels right as our wedding venue because it reflects our separate interests that have become increasingly shared. It also speaks to the coupling that we are, a synergy of disparate yet complementary qualities.
 
###### We're so excited for this October! We can't wait to celebrate with you in one of our favorite corners of the world.

## OUR STORY
 
###### Ken and I met at a bar in Manhattan on a fall evening in 2013. It was someone's birthday, which in those days was a reason to go out. I remember heading out for the night with low expectations, as meeting someone meaningful felt achingly out of reach at the time. But when I met Ken, I immediately felt hopeful.
 
###### I took note, approvingly, that Ken's shirt fit well and felt positively about his liquid-fueled confidence. I tricked Ken into thinking I was athletic by mentioning the century rides I had done earlier that year. Seeing that his phone's lock screen photo was one of Machu Picchu, we discussed the respective hikes we did there. I knew that I felt potential because I patiently repeated myself when he asked the same basic questions, paced in 20 minute intervals (I.e. "where are you from?"). When he asked for my number, I shared it. 
 
###### That hope persisted as we started to date. In the ensuing years, I've felt loved, protected and secure. I've experienced his selflessness. I know I am lucky.
 
###### This past November, Ken planned a "Paula-day" and we went to see the 'Josef Albers in Mexico' exhibit at The Guggenheim. Between the museum and a pre-planned dinner with my brother Matthew and his wife Eunice, we took a detour stop in Central Park. Ken loves Central Park, a place of nature in concrete NYC, and we always swing by when near it. But I knew something was up on this visit because of his insistence that we get there before the "sun goes down."

###### I've never cried so much on a single day - when he proposed, when I realized Ken had planted my brother and Eunice as covert photographers to capture the moment, when we swung by The West in Williamsburg post-dinner and I realized Ken had gathered all our NY-based friends there as a surprise. Ken cried too, but just during the proposal.

###### As we prepare for the wedding, we've been thinking a lot about the friends and family who have helped shape us individually and have supported us as a couple. You mean so much to us and we hope you can come celebrate as we commit to forever. We love you!
